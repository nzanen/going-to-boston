Going to Boston dice game project

Each player is given three dice. The dice will be rolled three times, with the highest number set aside each time. At the end of the playerâ€™s turn, the three numbers must be added up to give the final figure. Each player takes a turn until they have three numbers each. The winner with the highest overall number will be declared the winner.
